<p>Clang is a compiler, and it is also something my brain enjoys doing. Whimsical wordplay wins!</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a conference about conferences. It was the conference con.<br>
<em>The con con.</em></p>

<p>But secretly, it was all a deceptive scheme. A con.<br>
<em>The con con con.</em></p>

<p>The attendants were all of them deceived. It was actually a conference on dancing the can-can.<br>
<em>The can-can con con con.</em></p>

<p>At the end of the can-can, a man dressed as Genghis Khan came out of a cocoon to cheer the dancers.<br>
<em>The can-can con con con Khan cocoon.</em></p>

<p>The cocoon had previously been used on the set of King Kong.<br>
<em>The can-can con con con King Kong Khan cocoon.</em></p>

<p>But the event was also sponsored by Immanuel Kant society.<br>
<em>The can-can Kant con con con King Kong Khan cocoon.</em></p>

<p>The man dressed as Genghis Khan held a moon-shaped balloon.<br>
<em>The can-can Kant con con con King Kong Khan cocoon moon balloon.</em></p>

<p>On the balloon was a beautiful drawing of the Minnesota state bird, the loon.<br>
<em>The can-can Kant con con con King Kong Khan cocoon loon moon balloon.</em></p>

<p>Genghis Khan sung a song in rejoicing:<br>
<em>The can-can Kant con con con King Kong Khan cocoon loon moon balloon tune.</em></p>

<p><em>eeeeeeeeeee</em></p>
