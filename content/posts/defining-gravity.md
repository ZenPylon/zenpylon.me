What signifies significance?
What delivers deliverance?
What would words weave without warped wood?
On whose shoulders would
Newton have stood 
If he instead wanted to *defy* gravity?

Where to take a stand,
If words are to withstand?
All directions point accusations;
Only one is understood.

What do you stand on?
What do you stand for?
Who would you like to stand on you?

Would you know where your shoulders end 
and where their feet begin?
Would it frighten you to find the boundary blurred? 
Or would it be more unsettling to remember
That no thing ever really touches another,
That 'separate' and 'self' are lock-step?

When the coin is flipped, do you tighten
Your fist in anticipation? 
Which side are you rooting for?

Iâ€™m rooting for you.
