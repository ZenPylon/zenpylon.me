<p>What signifies significance?</p>
<p>What delivers deliverance?</p>
<p>What would words weave without warped wood?</p>
<p>On whose shoulders would</p>
<p>Newton have stood </p>
<p>If he instead wanted to *defy* gravity?</p>
<br>
<p>Where to take a stand,</p>
<p>If words are to withstand?</p>
<p>All directions point accusations;</p>
<p>Only one is understood.</p>
<br>
<p>What do you stand on?</p>
<p>What do you stand for?</p>
<p>Who would you like to stand on you?</p>
<br>
<p>Would you know where your shoulders end </p>
<p>and where their feet begin?</p>
<p>Would it frighten you to find the boundary blurred? </p>
<p>Or would it be more unsettling to remember</p>
<p>That no thing ever really touches another,</p>
<p>That 'separate' and 'self' are lock-step?</p>
<br>
<p>When the coin is flipped, do you tighten</p>
<p>Your fist in anticipation? </p>
<p>Which side are you rooting for?</p>
<br>
<p>I'm rooting for you.</p>
