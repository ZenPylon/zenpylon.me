<p>Shall I remain forever aloof</p>
<p>Like a dusty cloud of ambivalence;</p>
<p>A matching mirror nodding its</p>
<p>Unjustified equivalence?</p>
<br>
<p>Should I resign and agreeably feign</p>
<p>To enjoy that cloud of levity -</p>
<p>Deny myself and so remain</p>
<p>A chasm of passivity?</p>
<br>
<p>And what use are words on laden ears?</p>
<p>And whose words can dry fallen tears?</p>
<p>For talk is cheap and quickly sold</p>
<p>To hide a shoulder frozen cold.</p>
<br>
<p>Yet still no warmth can silence bring,</p>
<p>Such vacancy bears no repose.</p>
<p>So absence and advice alike</p>
<p>Appear officiously imposed.</p>
<br>
<p>Alas, the matching mirror cracks</p>
<p>From wise words seen but never spoken.</p>
<p>And those words uttered sadly fade</p>
<p>Their images now all but broken.</p>
<br>
<p>But shattered glass can still detect</p>
<p>The history of those that pass.</p>
<p> Each broken piece still more reflects;</p>
<p>A thousand shards, a thousand paths.</p>
<br>
<p>Thus I remain that looking glass,</p>
<p>A myriad of depth disguised.</p>
<p>For every image within itself</p>
<p>Holds its own potential realized.</p>
<br>
