Hi! I'm Andrew.

![A picture of Andrew Decker](/itsame.jpg)


I'm a software engineer based in Minneapolis. I really value curiosity, empathy, and self-reflection.

Outside of work, my hobbies include piano, meditation, running, and learning about basically anything. I'm a compulsive pun generator, and I feel a visceral delight in word play. Sorry in advance (I am not)!

I hold a B.A. in philosophy from the University of Minnesota.
