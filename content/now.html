<p>or what I'm up to lately.</p>

<h3>2024</h3>
<p>
  I'm working to deepen my knowledge of computer science fundamentals via
  <a href="https://csprimer.com/courses/" target="_blank">CS Primer</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math" target="_blank"
    >Napkin Math</a

</p>
<p>
  I'm also taking a course at the University of Minnesota:
  <em>EE5393 - Circuits, Computation, and Biology</em>.
</p>
<p>Outside of that, I'm doing a lot of soul-searching.<span class="inline-emoji">ðŸŒƒ ðŸ”¦</span></p>

  I learned Scriabin's Op. 16, a set of 5 short, beautiful preludes. Here's my

  I worked for a company called NextEra Analytics, building internal tools to
  facilitate the economic assessment of prospective renewable energy projects.

<p>I got laid off at the end of the year, so I'm looking for a new job!</p>
<h2>A Deeper Look</h2>
<p>
  I've been doing a lot of inner work lately, and I feel like I'm standing under
  a question mark. My relationship with uncertainty over the years has been
  fraught. Anxious rumination and catastrophic despair are frustratingly
  familiar patterns, and my mental Spotify frequently has them playing on loop.
  But recently, the question mark is less of a foreboding artifact looming
  overhead. Its more of an inverted hook wanting to weave its way over and pull
  me closer to somewhere I'm being called to.
</p>
<p>
  What's interesting is that I don't know where that is, or even who it is
  that's being pulled. I think this will be the year of cultivating the courage
  to explore those questions.

<p>
  One new thing is that I'm remaking my personal website. I've had a stub of a
  website for many years, but I've never done much with it. I'm looking to
  change that. I often shy away from putting myself on the page, so-to-speak. I
  enjoy making things and sharing them, but I don't do that nearly often enough.
  I want to use my personal website as a way to practice this.
</p>
<p>I'm searching for an identity, vision, and mission.</p>
