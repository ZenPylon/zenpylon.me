I&amp;rsquo;m Andrew.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer based in Minneapolis. I really value curiosity, empathy, and self-reflection.
Outside of work, my hobbies include piano, meditation, running, and learning about basically anything. I&amp;rsquo;m a compulsive pun generator, and I feel a visceral delight in word play. Sorry in advance (I am not)!
I hold a B.A. in philosophy from the University of Minnesota.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://zenpylon.me/now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zenpylon.me/now/</guid><description>Now or what I'm up to lately.
